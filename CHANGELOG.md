## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Terminal-state leak on TUI startup errors: a failure between enabling raw
  mode and constructing the terminal (entering the alternate screen, or the
  terminal's initial size query) now restores the terminal before the error
  propagates, instead of leaving the shell stuck in raw mode. Clean exits,
  propagated errors after startup, and panics were already covered by the
  guard and panic hook; this closes the remaining error window during setup.

### Added

- Shared domain model (Phase 1): `PortEntry` with the full
  protocol/address/port/state/process/parent/permission shape, plus the
  `Protocol`, `SocketState`, `Platform`, `PermissionStatus`, and `SortMode`
  vocabulary shared by the CLI, TUI, and future collectors.
- `Collector` trait with a deterministic `FakeCollector` covering full
  metadata, permission-restricted partial rows, IPv6, bound UDP, and a
  default-protected process name.
- Config file support: `~/.config/kickoutchi/config.toml` (XDG via `dirs`)
  with `refresh_interval_seconds`, `default_sort`, `confirm_force_kill`, and
  `protected_processes`; missing file means safe defaults, invalid file is a
  hard error naming the file and the bad value; bounded values and a capped
  protected list.
- Non-TUI CLI: `kickoutchi list` (`--port`, `--process`, `--json`) and the
  `kickoutchi kill` command shape (`--pid`/`--port`, `--force`, `--yes`) with
  confirmation prompts routed to a stub until real termination lands; CLI
  commands never open the TUI.
- Stable script-facing exit codes (0–6) defined and tested in one place;
  `--yes` never bypasses the protected-process path (exit 6).
- CLI-over-config precedence via global `--config <FILE>` and
  `--refresh-interval <SECONDS>` flags, with shared bounds enforced by clap at
  parse time.
- Table and JSON output layer; missing metadata renders as `-` in tables and
  `null` in JSON, and the JSON field/enum shape is pinned by tests.
- Cargo manifest metadata (`description`, `license`, `repository`, `authors`,
  `readme`) required for later `cargo publish`/`cargo-dist` phases.
- Project foundation (Phase 0): Rust 1.95.0 pinned via `mise.toml`, edition
  2024, and strict lints (`warnings = "deny"`, `clippy::pedantic`).
- Core dependency set: ratatui, crossterm, clap, serde, serde_json, toml,
  thiserror, anyhow, tracing, and tracing-subscriber.
- Module boundaries: `main`, `config`, `error`, and `ui`.
- Safe terminal lifecycle: an RAII `TerminalGuard` that enters raw mode and the
  alternate screen and restores both on drop (clean exit, propagated error, or
  panic), plus a panic hook that restores the terminal before the message prints.
- Minimal event loop with a bounded poll that quits on `q`, `Esc`, or `Ctrl+C`.
- `tracing` diagnostics routed to stderr only, never the TUI surface.
- Unit tests for the quit predicate, including the key-release edge case.
